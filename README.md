# Deep Dream Image Generation using TensorFlow - README

This repository contains Python code for generating abstract and dream-like images using the Deep Dream technique implemented with TensorFlow. Deep Dream is a neural network visualization technique that enhances patterns in images by modifying the image to maximize the activation of specific layers in a pre-trained neural network. This can result in surreal and artistic visuals.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- IPython

## Usage

1. **Clone Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the provided source code.

2. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**: Open the provided Jupyter Notebook file `DeepDream.ipynb`.

3. **Step-by-Step Execution**: The notebook is designed to guide you through the process of generating Deep Dream images. It consists of various sections, each with its specific functionality.

   ### Sections in the Notebook:

   - **Import Packages**: Required libraries and packages are imported at the beginning.

   - **Download Image**: An image is downloaded using the provided URL and a download function.

   - **Normalize and Display**: The downloaded image is normalized, displayed, and resized for visualization.

   - **Feature Extraction**: The InceptionV3 model is loaded, and specific layers are chosen for feature extraction.

   - **Loss Calculation**: Functions for calculating loss and gradients are defined.

   - **Deep Dream Class**: A class is defined to encapsulate the Deep Dream process.

   - **Simple Deep Dream**: The `deep_dream_loop` function is explained, which generates a simple Deep Dream image.

   - **Multi-Scale Deep Dream**: A more complex Deep Dream process involving multiple scales is presented.

   - **Random Rolling**: Rolling the image to create different patterns is demonstrated.

   - **Tiled Gradients**: A class is defined for computing gradients using tiled images.
